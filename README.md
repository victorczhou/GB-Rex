# GB-Rex
Chrome's T-rex runner on Gameboy. 

Assemble using [RGBDS](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds) and play using the [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/) emulator!

How to play:
1. Download the src directory.
2. Download and unzip RGBDS. Place RGBASM, RGBLINK, and RGBFIX in src.
3. Run makefile. (If on Windows, it is possible to use [GNU Make on chocolatey](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54086635), but you will need to replace the "rm" in the makefile with "del")
4. Download and unzip BGB. Run and load the .gb file from the src directory.
5. Use the 'up' key to jump and restart the game!

# GB-Rex
Chrome's T-rex runner on Gameboy. 

Assemble using [RGBDS](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds) and play using the [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/) emulator!

Notes:
- Makefile is currently for windows (replace del with rm on UNIX) - make sure you have RGBASM/RGBLINK/RGBFIX in the same folder as the files
- Use 'up' key to play/replay (or rebind in BGB)
